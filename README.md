# SafetySearch

> Search. Scan. Stay Safe.

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to FDA (Food and Drug Administration) data for **Food** safety information.

## üéØ What This Server Provides

This MCP server offers **8 tools** to access product safety data, helping users:
- Check product recalls and safety alerts for food products
- Monitor food safety issues and recall trends
- Analyze safety trends and company information
- Get comprehensive food safety insights

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip or uv package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/surabhya/SafetySearch.git
   cd SafetySearch
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Using pip
   pip install "mcp[cli]>=1.0.0" httpx>=0.24.0 pydantic>=2.0.0
   
   # Or using uv (recommended)
   uv add "mcp[cli]>=1.0.0" httpx>=0.24.0 pydantic>=2.0.0
   ```

## üîß Usage

### Using uv (Recommended)

> **Note:**
> If you have previously installed `mcp` in another project, or if you encounter errors like `Failed to spawn: mcp ... No such file or directory`, run:
> ```bash
> uv remove mcp
> uv add "mcp[cli]>=1.0.0"
> ```
> This ensures the `mcp` binary is correctly linked to your current environment.

#### Start the MCP Inspector (Development Mode)
Test and validate the server using the MCP Inspector:
```bash
uv run mcp dev server.py
```

#### Start the Server Directly
Run the server directly for testing:
```bash
uv run python server.py
```

#### Install in Claude Desktop (Production)
Install the server in Claude Desktop for production use:
```bash
uv run mcp install server.py
```
